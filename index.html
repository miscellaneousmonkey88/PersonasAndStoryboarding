      <p><strong>Welcome to my personas and storyboarding project! I decided to observe people use Brown's Mailroom Kiosks to
        understand the different personas who use this interface and what their experience is like. I've heard a multitude
        of complaints from my peers about the mail room system, so I thought it would be interesting to assess if and how
        the system could be optimized!

      <p><strong>OBSERVATIONS & INTERVIEWS</strong></p>

      <div id="txt">
      <p><strong>First, I needed to observe and interview users. I stood outside of the mail room and watched people swipe
        their cards at the kiosk.

              <p><strong>My Observations</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div id = "txt">
                I found that none of the users I observed successfully swiped their card on the first try. In fact, it took
                an average of 3 swipes for users to successfully use the card reader. One user even switched kiosks after a 
                multitude of failed attempts. All of the users I observed seemed to be in a rush, swiping aggressively and
                quickly, and barely looking at the screen as they press pick up packages. Another notable fact was that nobody 
                observed ever used the third kiosk located inside of the mail room.

                 <div id="pinkdash"><p>_</p></div>
                   Two of the users interviews used the mail room once or twice a month, while one used them every couple of days. The user who used it
                   every couple of days was also the user who struggled to carry all of their packages, and who had the most complaints about the mail room.

                     2. When and in what circumstances do you go to the mailroom? Are you usually in a rush between classes or do you plan your visits?
                    </i></strong></div>
                    <div id="pinkdash"><p>_</p></div>
                     All three users stated that they preferred to visit the mail room when they were 'in the area' between or after classes, and that
                     they would only ever plan a trip to the mail room if they knew they had a lot of mail arriving soon. They all stated that they were
                     usually in a rush to get somewhere afterwards when picking up their mail.
                      <div id="pinkdash"><p>_</p></div>
                <div id = "question-block"><strong><i>
                3. Have you ever had an experience with the Brown Mail Roomâ€™s electronic kiosks that stood out to you as particularly bad or good? If so, 
                could you elaborate on that experience?
              </i></strong></div>
              <div id="pinkdash"><p>_</p></div>
                Two of the three users that I interviewed had had a notable experience with the mail room. The first had a poor experience the first
                time they had gone, as a freshman, and could not figure out how to get the card reader to work. They reported feeling very
                embarassed and coming back the next day with a friend to get their mail. Another reported that they generally have a bad
                experience attempting to swipe their card, and that they went to the mail room recently and saw a sign above the kiosk that said 
                that if you swipe twice it pushes you to the bottom of the list. Their whole time at Brown, they'd been swiping twice, 
                so they were rather disappointed.

                  4. What is one functionality you would add to the Mailroom kiosks that would improve your experience?
                </i></strong></div>
                <div id="pinkdash"><p>_</p></div>
                  While two of the users interviewed simply responded that they wanted a better card reader, one stated that they would find it helpful
                  that if when the option to pick up your packages was displayed, they were not all displayed on the same line, so that one could
                  pick up only some of the packages at a time. This is because they often order a couple of large packages at a time, and find it
                  very difficult to carry them to their dorm all at once. They also found it confusing that there were two kiosks outside and another inside, as they couldn't 
                  tell if they all served the same purpose, and felt that it would be better if they were all next to each other.
